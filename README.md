Cold War is a political party game inspired to the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies. A match requires 5 to 13 players. Each player must be added to the game with a unique name. The players are automatically divided into 3 separate teams: CIA, KGB and Double agents. At the beginning of a match, no player knows the roles of the other players. The number of members in each team is related to the total number of players, according to the following table:


Once the teams are formed the match starts. A match is made of two turns. In each turn every player receives a mission. The players are called one by one and separately, so that no player knows the missions received by the other players. There are 7 possible missions:

    Murder: the player, regardless of his team, must cause another player to be eliminated, regardless of that player's team. If the mission is completed within the entire match, the player wins.
    
    Suicide : the player, regardless of his team, must get eliminated by the other players. If the mission is completed within the entire match, the player wins.
    
    Bodyguard: the player, regardless of his team, must avoid the elimination of another specific plater, regardless of that player's team. If the mission is completed within the entire match, the player wins.
    
    Confession: the player picks another player and shows him the team he belongs to.
    
    Dossier: the player picks a team and two players, and is informed if the players belong to that team.
    
    Tip: the player is informed of another player's team.
    
    Colleagues: the player sees the names of two players belonging to the seme team, but not the name of their team.

When each player has received a mission, a 5 minute timer is set to let the players discuss. Each player can share the information received and give information about its mission, with the possibility of lying.

After 5 minutes each player has to vote for the elimination of a player, including himself. The player that receives the highest nunmber of votes is eliminated. If there are players that received the same amount of votes, every player that received the maximum amount of votes is eliminated.

At the end of the first turn a second turn begins. The players who have received a "murder", "suicide" or "bodyguard" mission during the first turn can only receive a "confession", "dossier", "tip" or "colleagues" mission in the second turn.

At the end of the second turn the match ends and the winners are announced. The winning team is determined by the number of CIA and KGB members eliminated. If more CIA members are eliminated, the KGB wins, if more KGB members are eliminated, the CIA wins, and if the number of CIA and KGB members eliminated equals, the Double agents win, regardless of the number of members eliminated from their team. In addition to the members of the winning team, those who have eventually successfully completed a "murder", "suicide" or "bodyguard" mission are added to the winners of the game.
